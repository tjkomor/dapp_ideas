# dapp_ideas

This document is an attempt to highlight the current shortcomings in most resources currently available in the Web3/Dapp development space from
the perspective of a full stack engineer interested in transitioning into the space. A lot of the cons listed below may very well be pros for junior devs
or anyone from a less technical background who are interested in learning.


## Buildspace:

### PROS:
1. Accesible community (discord)
2. Logical, coherant syllabus
3. Can move at your own pace
4. Clearly defined end goal 
5. Clearly defined checkpoints

### CONS:
1. Very basic
2. Hard to understand how to take basic learnings and move to a higher level of        complexity
3. Skips over how things actually work
   Buildspace projects are the equivalent of teaching someone how to use Ruby on Rails (or any framework).
    You can make it work, and you can even reproduce a new project on your own after enough repitition,
    but you never learn what an HTTP request or response is, or how the data actually flows 
    from the client to the server. This is IMO the biggest downfall of the current state of 
    most web3 learning resources. 


## Ideas

Exercism but for Foundry
    <exercism.org>
    
    exercisms are a great learning resource where there are basic tests in place and your job is to 
    go implement the code that makes the tests pass. It's an awesome tool for learning a language.
    This concept could be applied to Foundry, but in a much more complex way. You could have some sort of a boilerplate
    app that anyone can fork or clone. This app has a bunch of objectives. An objective could be anything - making a test pass,
    using some specific feature of Foundry, creating a PR on a sweet open source dapp,
    directing you to an external resource about the importance of some concept in decentralized apps 
    and you come back and write some code that directly applies this concept.  

    This would not only accomplish learning how to use Foundry, but given the fact you actually need to use Foundry, you are
    also inherently learning about things that are critical to becoming a dapp developer who is capable of shipping production ready code.

    And so maybe it makes more sense to do some of what I'm suggesting without Foundry? I'm not sure. But from my POV,
    it seems like if you understand the tools available to you in Foundry, and how to use them, then you also probably have 
    a reasonbly good understanding of how to build a dapp and the important practices involved.
